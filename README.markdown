INSTEAD plugin for Vim (v.0.3.0)
==============================

This plugin will help you with creating INSTEAD text adventures.
It can show you the list of rooms/objects/dialogs for fast navigation 
and run INSTEAD with the current file.

It is in the early stage of development, so it contains ton of bugs, I think.
